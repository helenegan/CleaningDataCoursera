Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains 3 files:
1) run_analysis.R - R script to clean Samsung data
2) tidy_data.txt - an output dataset generated by run_analysis.R
3) CodeBook.md - code book describing variables in tidy_data

To generate a tidy data set run the script from run_analysis.R.
Please, make sure you have downloaded in your working directory the raw data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and have installed all packages from the course.

The data will be written in tidy_data_txt file in your working directory. Alternatively the data will be contained in tidy_data_set variable.
